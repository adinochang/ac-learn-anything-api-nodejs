## Technologies Used

* **Node.js**
* **Express.js**
* **TypeScript**
* **OpenAI API**
* **PostgreSQL**
* **Drizzle-ORM**

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

* Docker Desktop
* Access to an OpenAI API key.
* A running PostgreSQL instance. For development purpose, use Neon (a cloud PostgreSQL service)

Additional pre-requisites without docker:

* Node.js (LTS version recommended)
* npm (comes with Node.js) or Yarn

### Installing and Running the Application

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/adinochang/ac-learn-anything-api-nodejs.git
    ```

2.  **Set up Environment Variables:**

    Create a `.env` file in the root of your project. You may copy it from `sample.env`. This file will contain sensitive information and configuration.
    

3. Installing and Running the Application **with Docker**

    Start the docker container:

    ```docker compose up```

4. Installing and Running the Application **without Docker**

    **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd ac-learn-anything-api-nodejs
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

    **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    cd ac-learn-anything-api-nodejs
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```
    The API should now be running, typically on `http://localhost:3000` (or the `PORT` specified in your `.env` file).

5. Initialize the database **with Docker**

    * Launch Docker Desktop and open the nodejs_learn_anything container
    * Use the Exec tool
    * Run the drizzle-kit commands:
    ```bash
    npx drizzle-kit generate
    npx drizzle-kit migrate
    ```
    
6. Initialize the database **without Docker**

    ```
    cd ac-learn-anything-api-nodejs
    npm run drizzle-generate
    npm run drizzle-migrate
    ```    

## Project Structure

A typical Node.js Express.js API project structured with TypeScript often looks like this:

```
